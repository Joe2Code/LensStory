It’s gonna be a good day.", "Excitement fills you like a warm cup of coffee as you perk your mind for the day ahead. You take a quick look around in your apartment that’s shared between you and your roommate but eventually your gaze takes its stop near your computer desk where a neatly ordered outfit was prepared the night before", "The combination of getting up early and neatly order clothes give a surreal experience for today. This day is unlike any other day, something that could spark a future career change for your photography desires. Or maybe not, but everything starts with an opportunity right?", "You carefully dress yourself in the outfit, careful not to wrinkle or fold it in a way much like someone would balance a plate of fine glasses on their nose.","Thoughts of the past few days present themselves – a contest on social media, a potential career for winning a scavenger hunt, the dreams of finally doing what you love - the things that make it seem more surreal.", "Since the time is plenty until your so-called interview, you know just the place to go.", "You start walking outside your apartment and head downstairs, opening the door to the streets of the beautiful downtown city of San Avery.", "The city has a wonderfully etched skyline, a highlight being the Avery Walkway, an enclosed glass sky bridge that connects two skyscrapers together over the connecting downtown and park districts.", "Around this time a day, the sun is rising from the harbor. Currently, there’s an easy rising sunrise that’s cuddled by a few cotton clouds with their fringes nearly pulling the sun back to the horizon as if to enjoy the waxing morning for a few minutes more.", "But the people of San Avery have already begun their routine, ignoring the sunrise like most days.", "You made your way to Harriet Harbor, the water “cul-de-sac”, and find a place to enjoy what little nature you can find in the busy city. There is a coffee shop right before the harbor and you get the usual London Fog tea latte and walk to your favorite bench.", "To your relief, your bench is available and not taken by any of the dog walkers or newspaper readers nearby. The song of seagulls provide an ambiance of clear thinking as you sit your camera down on the wooden bench in case that perfect picture presents itself.", "Today is the big day. Two weeks prior, you found a contest from the San Avery Times, the popular newspaper and website news source in the city. They held a contest to submit photos, and the best photos could get you into a scavenger hunt contest to match articles that they have written.", "The best three photographers in the hunt will be offered a full time position at the company. But you never thought you would make it through the process. Nevertheless, here you are: drinking a latte in a harbor early in the morning, just waiting to show up for the contest.", "You stay for an extra 15 minutes, taking in the scenery and pondering existential thoughts, then you make your way to the train.", "Anticipation takes you through the mundane movements of scanning your ticket and enduring the subway with a crowd of unknowns, whatever their demands or dreams require of them this day. You quickly arrive at your stop on 16th Street downtown San Avery.", "You see the big building with the large letters labelled San Avery Times. You're here. You’ve begun the journey.", "You were greeted with a warm welcome despite the nervousness you presented in return.", "'Welcome to the San Avery Times!,' they said. They reminded you that you were one of the contestants for the Photo Product scavenger hunt.", "You were quickly given a photo request to accomplish, and once that was finished you'd come back for the next one. They gave you a quick tour of the office, grabbed some coffee from the break room, and let you begin your story.", "Your Photo Request: A Water Bottle"]

let oneTwo: [String] = ["Your first photo was done. You submit your photo on your laptop during the evening hours and you prepare for a good nights sleep, ready to show up the next morning at the SA Times.", "With the urban lights outside as your only source of vision, you make your way to the kitchen to make yourself some tea.", "A familiar glance at something is seen on the table. When you move in closer, you see the SA Times logo. Upon your creeping suspicion, the paper is just like the one you received today about the contest, but you’ve keep your paperwork hidden away.", "This one has your roommates faded apartment keys and a half filled water bottle next to it. Is your roommate in the contest too?", "If only you could talk to your roommate but they have gone to bed for the night and you need to be out before they wake up.", "Thoughts of competition enter your mind as you reminded yourself that only 3 people can have full time positions.", "Debating between waking them up or not, you realize that your eyes are losing its grip on gravity as you feel the exhaustion of waking up so early. You save your tea, which is now lukewarm, and head upstairs to finish out the night.", "But the thoughts still bind your late hours to the night...", "Could your roommate be in the contest as well? What are the chances we could both me working for the SA Times full time? What would happen if one of us gets an offer but the other does not?","You wake up on the early morning hours from the previous day and headed straight to SA Times. Your contest represenative was already there waiting to give you the next request", "The next photo needed was related to a furniture company called Vision Office Pro, whose products are making progress in the office world.", "Your Photo Request: A Desk"]

let oneThree: [String] = ["You have taken your second picture", "You log in to your computer at the local coffee shop called Ground Running that’s located near Centennial Park. You wait for the spinner on the log in screen to complete itself as you look outside the window to the busy streets with the molten colored sun beginning to reflect on the glass", "Sunset is near. You continue on the computer, instinctively ignoring everyone that isn’t bringing you a hot cup of washed Ethiopian coffee", "You submit your photo and you can safely relax for the evening. As perfect timing would have it, your coffee arrives and you can feel the vapor from the onyx colored liquid as it warms your face for a brief second", "You close your laptop and sip your coffee, just enjoying the scene of a kicked-back afternoon", "The simulation plays in your mind of what others in the coffee shop are thinking. What of the guy in the suit with the cellphone always next to his ear? Or what of the two girls just chatting away and haven’t sipped their drinks in ten minutes, despite both of them holding them in their hands?", "Or what about the younger man with a backpack, his notebook in his lap and concentrating so much as to miss even the end of the world?", "But perhaps what of yourself, O watcher of people?", "Your simulation ends and you decide to leave the coffee shop to take a ride home. You wait outside for a ride share as you feel the blanket of the sun sweep over the sky. Thoughts of yesterday come to mind of the paperwork you saw of your roommate", "It finally hits you as you realize the busyness of today took over your common sense. I guess I could just text my roommate and ask? So you do. The ride share arrives.", "As you get home, you get a text from your roommate saying ”Yes, I’m in the contest! I heard you were too. I’m already gone for the weekend but we should catch up when I get back!” So that settles it.", "You mentally check out for the night and forget the whole roommate thing. I mean after all you have the whole weekend to yourself, right? You hit the bed without concern as to even turn the lights off", "The next morning during your breakfast routine, you get an email from the SA Times. Your manager is out for next week and will give you photo requests through email exchange and their conferencing app", "Your next photo needed is for article discussing the history behind the San Avery bridge that connects the bay to the other side of the city", "Your Photo Request: A Bridge"]

let oneFour: [String] = ["You must be getting the hang of this! Sending off the last photo was a breeze now that you don’t need to be in the office for the next week. You close your laptop being in boredom of waiting for the next photo.", "The apartment is empty. The refrigerator is empty, like it ever has food anyway? But you have time on your hands. The weekend is young and you get dressed to head out to the local sandwich shop called the Rusty Shop. A classic hole in the wall near the Bay. Sounds perfect.", "You leave your apartment and head down Cardigan Avenue. Quite a busy street and you are always surprised by the severe monotony of the average San Avery pedestrian’s appearance. Most never make eye contact with anyone or release themselves from their devices.", "You walk down Cardigan for about half a mile then turn right on Duxley Avenue where the Rusty Shop is. It’s a full house there as you see people waiting in line outside of the shop. Its worth the wait and you get in line, counting the customers and hope no one gets more than one sandwich.", "One hour later and you leave the shop with a club sandwich and some cheese fries in a box to take over to the Bay. It’s a clear day with no clouds in sight and you can already hear the seagulls from Centennial Park.", "You walk past the coffee stand you got the London Fog from last week and walk toward an overlook in the waters. A really good day to enjoy a Rusty sandwich at the Bay.", "You throw pieces of your bread into the water as fish flop from out of the waters to get a snack. You are also surprised to hear a familiar voice behind you. It’s one of your old college mates.", "You stop eating your sandwich that takes every part of your being not to eat it during conversation. It’s been four years since you saw your college mate that you were close to, but after graduation, well...life happens.", "Your friend tells you their story about how they went to work for a while but ended up getting their career job as a financial strategist. You talk for a few more minutes until your college mate needs to leave, but asked to take a selfie together.", "You get out your phone as you try to wrap your sandwich. Your eyes fixate on a pickle in the sandwich that’s trying to fly out to the ground. But you manage to wrap it without noticing your obsession to saving all of your sandwich.", "You take your phone out to take a selfie. Pointing the front camera to the both of you, you place your thumb close to the button, just waiting for the camera to focus. In that split second of waiting, an email notification pops up for your next photo session.", "You ignore the email at least to your college mate, take the selfie, and head out to finish your sandwich and prep for your next photo.", "Photo Request: a phone"]

let oneFive: [String] = ["Upload complete. You finished yet another picture in the contest. The only downside is that your weekend is almost over now, but at least you don’t need to be in the office on Monday. You stare at your laptop while sitting on the couch, seemingly to forget your surroundings in the empty apartment.", "The faint sound of raindrops can be heard outside the window. You sit your laptop down, tilting against the camera bag, and relax on the couch. The sound of rain overtakes the night and you sleep until the next morning.", "The sound of construction wakes you up abruptly, which guessing the time when they have started last week, it’s close to 9 o’clock. Going to the kitchen to make start some coffee, you check your phone and discover another email from SA Times.", "The email reads: 'Good morning, photographers! We have had a lot of success and discussion about the scavenger hunt photo contest. We have an important announcement and also some news.'", "'First, it didn’t take long for the news to grab hold of our contest story and now it has gained city wide attention and some national news. That’s really great for everyone! Also, we are including this now as part of the hunt.", "So for all the photographers still left, try to take a photo of something iconic about the city of San Avery.'", "'Second, as you may have picked up from the “photographers still left”, we have had a handful of you already quit the contest. There are now only 12 of you. So congratulations to the 12 still standing.'", "'Finally, because of the citywide and national attention, our Digital Manager will come back early and be in the office Wednesday morning.'", "'We were not expecting either myself or the DM to be there everyday, but because of the media attention we will change the scheduling for the hunt. We are now requiring everyone in the contest to report to the main office in downtown San Avery every morning by 9am. Good luck!'", "Well, I guess there’s my next photo request — something iconic about the city. The Averson Tower is pretty iconic, it’s one of the buildings that is always in front of the Sky Bridge and named after Jorge Averson, the person who first discovered San Avery. Let’s try for that.", "Photo Request: a skyscraper"]

let oneSix: [String] = ["You finished getting an iconic part of the City of San Avery and you went out to take a picture of the Averson Tower.", "Its now mid afternoon and the subway is close by, which is a good change of pace to get back home. You soak in the ability to relax despite the busyness of the people around you. The subway takes an arch shape over the north part of the city, and the stop at your apartment in close to 30 minutes to get there.", "Thoughts come to mind about the city. Do you really like the city life? What will come from the national news of the contest...I mean regardless if you make the full time position, your going to be semi famous right? And maybe that’s something?", "The subway ride goes by fast as you get to your stop. You work your way through the neighborhood underneath the overcast sky and make it to the apartment. As you open the door, you discover the smell of garlic and pasta.", "Your roommate must be home. Thoughts of competition run through your mind in regards to the contest. But you remain peaceful and hopeful that there will be no strife.", "You walk through the living room and see your roommate on the couch. Your roommate speaks to you.", "'Oh hey, your back home! How was your weekend? I was out with some friends this past weekend. We went camping but I managed to get some of the pictures for the contest too. That’s pretty cool that we are both in the contest, right? I hope we both can make it through to the full time.'", "You give an answer to your silent weekend of rainy days and the Rusty Shop sandwich. It was a good silent weekend. You give encouragement for the contest as well.", "Fortunately there seems to be no drama involved, despite the low odds that both of you will get a full time gig. You talk a few more minutes and head upstairs.", "Two hours later, you can hear what seems to be crying while you are in your room. You silently leave the room to see if something’s wrong. You discover your roommates’ tears while they seem to be talking on the phone.", "Cloaked in tears you hear the words 'Okay, keep me updated.' Not wanting to disturb the conversation, you go back to your room for the night.", "As you suspected the next morning, you get another email: 'Here is your next photo request. We are looking for a picture to talk about the improvements for the San Avery subway due for next year. Don’t forget to show up on Wednesday!'", "Photo Request: a train"]

let oneSeven: [String] = ["Wednesday morning rolls around. You are still in your routine of setting out your outfit and you wake up hours early just like you did before. After you get dressed and head downstairs, you discover that your roommate is not home.", "Thoughts of last night enter your mind. Did something bad happen? Why was your roommate crying? What prompted your roommate to leave so early? You grab a muffin from the table and head out to the Harriet Harbor again, toward the coffee stand", "The sky is slightly overcast from the rainy weekend, but the sunrise is dissipating any evidence of the precipitating clouds of days past. Walking toward the harbor, you peel back that waxy muffin cup with elements of baked goodness attached to it.", "As you take a bite, you look up and see your roommate walking toward you as if they were coming back to the apartment. Your roommate sees you, but gives the mannerism that they don’t want to interact. But a greeting comes to you anyway.", "'Hey, just walking out to the harbor?' You say yes and ask if they want to join. 'Sure, I’ll go. I was just...trying to get some time alone. It’s hard to do that in the city.' You notice your roommate has a new and very nice camera on their shoulder you’ve never noticed before.", "“Going to the coffee stand again by the harbor?”, your roommate asks. You nod your head and keep walking as they follow.", " No words are exchanged but as the sunrise finally wakes the morning shy and the clouds vanish, you can feel a warmer atmosphere than what you heard from the tears last night. You want to ask what’s going and you feel you can shortly.", "You walk up to the coffee stand and order the usual. Your roommate orders a standard latte with an extra espresso. The silence after the order causes you to look to the harbor and see the complete lack of social experiences that you would normally see -", "— no men or women running with neon colored shoes or fitness wearables, no one walking their dog (or perhaps the dog walking them), no older men talking about days past trying to be louder than the shuffling of there daily newspapers. Nothing.", "It’s as if the morning was overcast enough to assume one should stay in for one last morning. The park at the harbor was basically silent except for the sound of seagulls.", "You sit down with your roommate at a nearby bench and take in the harbor coloring itself to life as the sun finally takes its flight from the horizon. Silence still seems to be the main subject. Finally, your roommate speaks.", "'What do you think life is about?' Well that statement seemed to come from nowhere, or perhaps from what your heard last night, maybe not. You reply, 'I’m not following what your saying, is everything okay?'", "'Yes, everything seems to be fine. Well how’s your scavenger hunt going for the contest? I know you were surprised I was involved. I should have told you about it I suppose. In fact, I’m almost done with getting all the pictures.'", "'I’d give you hints for the next ones they’d ask you to get, but it’s a random set of photos they ask for.' A true statement that the photos are random, and a difficult thing to hear that your roommate, much less anyone, is nearly done.", "That could mean one spot could be nearing to be filled. Perhaps the tears heard yesterday were tears of joy? You can’t seem to discern anything from the lack of information, mixed signals, and the avoidance of questions.", "For the next 20 minutes, you’re able to have a reasonable conversation by just catching up on the past month, thinking of old memories, and nerding out with your cameras and their features. You momentarily forget about the contest but your roommate’s camera makes you think of it again.", "It’s a very high end camera and not quite sure how it was an affordable expense, not that it’s any of your business. After some time, you both realize it’s time to head to the meeting.", "You arrive at the meeting and are all welcomed to a new layout of the contest because of all the national news. It is there also that you are given your next photo assignment.", "Photo Request: a guitar"]

let oneEight: [String] = ["After your photo assignment, you talked to some of the other contestants and went out to get that perfect picture.", "You were able to make it back to the SA Times in the early afternoon. You managed to submit your digital copy of the assignment and head your way out, while getting the next assignment as you left.", "Taking a flight of stairs to the subway, the business of rush hour overwhelmed the area and your camera bag slipped off your shoulders like buttered up swine in an old country faire. You watch in shock as your bag falls down the flight of stairs onto the steps on a different flight below.", "There were some that allowed you shock room and give a pathway to your bag. Rushing down the flight of stairs, you cautiously open your bag to discover that part of your camera has been broken. Devastation fills your being as you do everything to get home without anyone looking at you.", "When you arrive at the apartment, you arrive once again to an empty shell of a place. Panic settles in as you have an overwhelming pressure to get another camera before the end of the day.", "Like watching a car accident, you open your bank app on your smartphone and to your lack of surprise you don’t have enough money to buy a new camera.", "Thoughts play into mind once again...others are way ahead of the contest and this could push you behind. Or perhaps you should just give up? Even the pleasantness of spending time with your roommate at the park turns dark as you feel that something is against you in your pursuit of a full time career.", "After all, your roommate has the nice high end camera and your on the low spectrum of about 3/4 of a normal one. These thoughts take a momentary pause along with your lack of afternoon food as you speed walk to the nearest camera rental place called A Lens Story.", "You arrive well faster than you would have waking but it felt like two decades have passed. Out of breath, you take a look at their collection of cameras, and manage to find a similar one like yours.", "The comparison reeks of flashbacks of an hour ago where your camera took a fall of nearly unmentionable proportions. A man at the counter greets you.", "'Welcome, are you in need to rent a camera?' Fancy that! You explain that you need a camera for at least a month. The man gets the camera that you want but takes his time as he tries to tell a story.", "'You know, Im always glad to see someone come in for a camera. Each one of these cameras for rent have been pre-owned but also in great shape. It’s one of the reasons why I have the name A Lens Story. Every camera has a story to tell and every person has their part in a bigger story.'", "You listen to his monologue of hope about stories as you get more irritated by the second on the inside.", "Finally you are able to checkout and take the camera home for a month. You decide to chill out for an hour before you start your next photo assignment, trying to calm down from what just happened.", "You simultaneously care that you shouldn’t be chilling out but you also don’t care because it seems things haven’t gone your way.", "You fix yourself some food, hoping you haven’t lost the contest already.", "Photo Request: a camera"]

let oneNine: [String] = ["Robotics took over the rest of your afternoon as you managed to get your assignment finished before the next day. Your goal has been to get at least one assignment completed per day.", "When you woke up for the morning, you looked at the outfit you’ve prepared and put it on without the desires as you used to. To no surprise, your roommate was gone again.", "The same routine plays in your mind in repetition - breakfast, harbor, London Fog, subway, downtown. You now realize how people get stuck into monotonous and apathetic habits. You make it to the SA Times headquarters to your discovery that your 5 minutes late to the meeting. Just perfect.", "You get a few stares and you find a seat in the conference room, trying to pretend you’ve been there the whole time. Your Digital Manager ignored your entrance and continued to talk.", "'So like I said, we will have the local media stop by soon and ready to talk to all of us. This has been a bigger deal for the city than we suspected, and we will give them some brief time today.'", "'What’s important for you is that they will be here tomorrow morning to talk to all of you, either as a collective or as an individual. So we need to be here earlier than usual and be ready to talk all day.'", "'Another announcement is that the San Avery professional baseball team, the San Avery Sun Sharks, would like us to attend and take pictures of the Mayor’s first pitch. This is a big deal. There will be a lot of news coverage of this. You are invited to attend whether you have won the photo contest or not.'", "'Speaking of the contest, we have already selected one person for a full time status. They have finished their rounds of photos and have taken an excellent job in their quality and professionalism. We will not reveal the winner as of now, but just know their are two spots remaining.'", "'Also we have had two more photographers withdrawal from the contest for other opportunities, so with those two along with the one winner, there are now 9 of you competing for two spots. Good luck again.'", "Visuals of calculus projected into the air — two spots left for nine people —  a 22% chance is not bad. Much better than you hoped.", "But the odds of both you and your roommate getting the last two spots are less likely. You’ve had a rough week and honestly, it’s been a difficult road your whole life to get to this point.", "You see your roommate at the conference about the same time it’s ending, but it seems your roommate is meeting with the Assistant DM Claire.", "What is that about? You receive your next photo assignment from an employee and try not to pay any attention to anyone else.", "Photo Request: a space heater"]

let oneTen: [String] = ["You were able to get a good picture after the meeting during the evening hours. Starving, you find a nearby place that serves some good Asian food. You walk in to discover the place isn’t very packed and being able to sit and eat is no problem.", "You tuck your rental camera close in your lap, preventing another bad mishap, where this one would cost you even more money by paying for a replacement. Eating, you get an email from SA Times again for your next photo assignment. That sure was fast this time!", "You try to scarf down your bulgogi tacos so you can check out the next request. Just when your about to finish, someone walks up to you.", "They are hesitant to say anything, starting to speak at a whisper. “Are...are you part of the photo contest at the San Avery Times?” They point some papers sticking out of your backpack that have their logo on it.", "You reply that you are, and they get excited and want to take a picture with you. Although your reluctant, you take a selfie with them.", "They begin to ask you some questions about the contest which your not able to answer for confidential reasons. However, they say they wouldn’t mind getting some pictures taken with them for an upcoming event, and they slide you their business card.", "You say thanks, despite the awkward invitation to call them to setup a photo session, and you go about your way. As you leave, you have a good feeling about that. You have received some recognition for the photo contest.", "Perhaps there’s a consolation for not winning after all. You realize halfway to getting home that you received an email for your next photo. You open the email with the confidence that you can just do whatever the day requires. A normal feeling day for once", "Photo Request: a drone"]

let oneEleven: [String] = ["You sent off your photo request later that night and went straight to bed. Exhaustion sets in from the last week of photo taking and camera stress. Your roommate wasn’t home again, but it’s not like you are there to keep track anyway.", "The morning arrives once again, on time as always but still seems to arrive too fast. You’re a little more desirable to dress and get ready for the news and social media outlets having an interview at SA Times today. Your normal schedule feels like it has a purpose once again.", "You make your way downstairs to make some coffee instead of going out to the harbor. Of all things, you discover a note by your roommate saying that they have left for the rest of the week again. Unsure of what to think, you lay the note back on the kitchen table and continue your routine.", "Heading to the subway, thoughts come around again. Why did your roommate leave in the middle of the week this time? Did they finish the photo project?", "After all the news media photo and interviews are today. Perhaps your roommate got the full time job and took the rest of the week to relax? What was up with the crying the other day? Oh well.", "More thoughts of polarization come to mind. You are barely making it through with a rental camera and no good source of income. Things seemed that they would work out better after college. But now the college degree is in the past, just like your college friends and you moved from your family.", "All of your thoughts mesmerize yourself on the subway and you arrive at the headquarters.", "You get into the office and a few of the contestants are there was well. Two of the local news channels and other smaller media outlets are there to make everyone in the contest part of the story this morning for the city of San Avery.", "Much to the surprise of your social awkwardness, no one singled you out to interview you. Everything seems to be done as a collective and went rather smoothly although it seemed to be a little corny. The last of the media left at noontime.", "When the news and media were finished, you were personally received your last photo assignment.", "The assignment was to take a photo of the harbor for an article that focuses on the coastal edge of the city. Imagine that? The place you frequent often is the place where you will compete your scavenger hunt. Such irony.", "The company says that you have two days to get the photo in. Tomorrow will be the Mayor’s first pitch. After that, the winners of the contest will be announced.", "Photo Request: a lakeshore"]

let oneTwelve: [String] = ["You went to the harbor where you first went on the morning before the contest, brought your rental camera and your laptop, and took what you thought was the perfect picture and uploaded it to the company.", "The last picture. You even waited for the sun to hit over on the harbor at just the right time, giving a prismatic reflection on the water. After you uploaded the picture, you sit back to enjoy the last hour before sunset. It was crowded, but you managed to ignore the social noise of the scenic evening.", "The news media event earlier today was a change of pace. You’ve nearly forgotten about all the difficulties of the last two weeks and all the strange turns from your life so far. As a nice add on, you have tomorrow as a day off. And you still have Harriet Harbor to enjoy and relax.", "You grabbed some frozen yogurt on your way home that you had never tried before, but you were curious what the fuss was about. It was also a change of pace - a change of creamy goodness bundled with lemon and graham crackers. A place to kept in mind for future reference.", "You make it back to the apartment as you felt the hollow silence of emptiness within the place — no lights have been left on, no clocks displayed on the microwave. Nothing.", "You gather the thoughts that the power had went out at some point. But the lack of power gives thought to the contrast of the apartment life you’ve been living instead of the life your trying to achieve.", "The apartment gives the presence of dark and lonely and cold. Even your nice clothes you wear to the contest goes dim in the apartment.", "In contrast, the life of the harbor and the publishing company brings elements of happiness of social importance.", "Perhaps if you win the contest, you could move to one of the nice apartments that overlook the Harbor. I’m sure your roommate wouldn’t mind. It’s not like they are even here anyway. You transition to your bedroom into your normal nighttime routine, and fall asleep.", "You wake up to the bliss of knowing you’ve slept in for over four hours. The silence of the apartment that brought dread and loneliness has now brought peace and quiet. You find your smartphone and the bright numbers contrasting your awakening eyes highlight the realization of an afternoon start.", "Feeling ambitious, you set off to Rusty’s again for a sandwich and head to the harbor once again.", "You get to the harbor and as you arrive, you remember that there’s a business owner that has a famous place where he has modified his large boat to hold a cafe and relaxation area.", "You pay the fee to get onboard and your able to stay on as long as you like. They have areas for coffee sipping, dining, or just relaxing.", "The harbor feels more intimate now that you’ve jumped on board. You feel the wind much stronger and colder, but it’s still welcoming.", "You sit in a nook slightly away from the exterior seating to avoid the winds, as wonderful as they are, so you can open your laptop and update your resume and apply for some jobs.", "And, a great view for a picture for your portfolio.", "Photo Request: a boat"]

Delight sets in as you feel the city is opening up to you.", "Your delight sets into relaxation as your forget everything for about two hours, then finally go home to prepare for the first pitch photo shoot.", "You’ve never been a huge fan of baseball, but you received a San Avery Sun Sharks jersey before as a present in college. Your uncle that used to live in San Avery gave you the jersey as a gift when you went to college.", "You geared up, jersey and camera along with your special photographers pass and go to headquarters where they all take the subway together.", "You arrive at the stadium and after an hour of shuffling through people and areas, you arrive at the grass field where the athletes play. Your digital manager addressed everyone and goes through the routine of what would happen and that he expects copies of your pictures as well.", "As the minutes get closer to the first pitch, the place gets louder and louder.", "The game started an hour before sunset and the usual routine of the game played out — the greeting to the attendees and the singing of the national anthem. Then the mayor goes out to throw the first ceremonial baseball pitch. Most of the contestants were there.", "You noticed that your roommate was not there, which would keep faithful to the note that was left for you. There was no possible way that they would get the job. Perhaps your roommate bowed out early like what was mentioned earlier in the week. That would match up with why they left too.", "Everyone was out in the ball field. It was a surreal experience being immersed in a crowd of thirty thousand people. The Mayor stood at the mound and we all took pictures, the flashing of lights strobing on first base line.", "Just as the Mayor was about to throw the first pitch, you take a step back at everything in the past two weeks — the struggles of the contest, assumptions about your roommate, a broken camera, great pictures, the harbor in its San Avery glory, and now a baseball game where you are in the spotlight.", "You take a picture right when the Mayor is in mid throw to make the pitch.", "More strobing lights of the camera flashes, more noise of the crowd, and then finally you make it to the club seats. For once, you opened yourself up to the other contestants. It was a great time and on top of it all, the Sun Sharks won.", "It felt good to be on the up and up. It felt good to take pictures of the first pitch. Everything felt good.", "Photo Request: a baseball"]

let oneFourteen: [String] = ["You got home late, close to midnight, but you had a great time. You even got a signed baseball from one of the Sun Shark players. Your wake up in excitement and quickly get minimally dressed and make some breakfast.", "After making your egg and cheese sandwich, you get an email from the San Avery Times. It’s an email about the winners of the contest. Finally this contest can be put to a close.", "It read, 'Dear contestants, it’s been a great privilege to see the creativity of all the photographers that joined the contest. It helps to see that the future in photography is bright with people that love their job. I want to announce the winners of the contest...'", "You skim the email to find the contestant winners.", "In the middle of the email, you discovered three names...none of which were yours. But one name was your roommate’s.", "You close your laptop, halfway making it slam to the keyboard.", "You frustratingly get up and walk to the harbor, your zone of comfort. You quickly think of ways to get a real job in photography. You are devastated that you didn’t get a full time job for the best digital publishing company in San Avery", "You arrived at the harbor and attempt to get you usual London Fog at the coffee stand. You struggle to get the words out of your mouth, trying to pay with your phone. In a lack of concentration and overwhelming feeling of frustration, you drop your phone and the screen cracked.", "You get short with the coffee stand barista to just hurry and make your beverage. They get silent and make your London Fog as you feel the joy and happiness of the past two days get over casted to massive clouds that are prepared to drench the whole day.", "You get the coffee and walk to the harbor. It’s way busier than usual because the weekend has started. Your bench has been taken and the next five benches in either direction.", "You take the consolation of a bench farther away from the harbor edge — a bench that no one used because of it’s close proximity to an open trash can.", "You lost the contest. Your roommate won.", "You have nothing but a rental camera and a broken phone. How did the last 12 hours take a turn for the worse? Your roommate barley showed up to the company headquarters, much less was even in town. Your roommate with the nice camera.", "Hate begins to settle in but you try to fight it off. You struggle in your mind at the garbage can bench. Ten minutes later, you receive a back log of notifications.", "You received a few notifications, but as things started going from bad to worse, you received a email from the company you applied at saying they already filled the position. Tears overflow as you sit there, hoping the smell of the garbage can dismisses any contact you would normally get for crying in public.", "But you also received a text. It’s from your roommate. It read, 'Hey, I’m coming back in town early. I need to talk to you.' Sure, whatever.", "Your roommate probably wants to brag and is arriving early so they can prepare for the full time job. You stay at the harbor for another two hours, then start to head back home", "On your way out of the harbor, two people see you walking by and it appears they haven’t seen each other in a long time. They ask if you can take a picture of them against the water and the skyline. You fight everything and keep it invisible for the brief time it takes to take the photo, but seems like an hour.", "You took the photo and headed home.", "Photo Request: a trash can"]

let oneFifteen: [String] = ["You got back to the apartment in a mood of disgust at everything. The stuffy walls of your bedroom, the stone steps at the front of the apartment with its cracks.", "You go to your room and throw off your silly clothes and launch all the clothes across the room that you had prepared for the contest each day. You end up falling asleep.", "You wake up four hours later, in the evening, thinking of some food to eat. You can only think of junk food and ice cream. You look at your phone and notice that your roommate had texted you saying they would be at the harbor if they wanted to meet up.", "Really? You now want the one place that I feel at peace? You quickly got up and put on the simplest of clothes, not sure if the shirt you put on is new or dirty - it smelled fine at least and you were not in the mood to care.", "You grabbed your bag to take some things with you, then realized you left your sandwich in their from the Rusty’s sandwich shop.", "You noticed the condensation inside the bag from the heat and you are well too experienced in sandwich expirations to be absolutely sure not to open it. You tossed it in the trash and walked to the harbor, nearing a sunset.", "The sunset didn’t seem to beautiful like normal days. It seemed to never set, keeping its focus on your back so people could notice you when you least wanted to. It was an amazing realization that everything you once enjoyed had turned into a bane in your life when you lose your sense of purpose.", "You felt as if the sun setting the whole time has even caused the fire in yourself to increase, as if your eyes had even turned red when you looked at someone. You made it to the harbor and found your roommate, of all places, at your favorite bench.", "You arrived in silence but just waiting to explode. But your roommate decided to talk first.", "'So yeah, how are you doing? Listen, it’s been a crazy two weeks for me. But as you may have picked up from my absence that something has came up and I need to adjust to what’s ahead of me.'", "Really? Frustrated, you say anything negative that has come up since the beginning of the contest. How your acceptance into the contest turned into competition when you found out they made the contest too. How competition turned to indifference as the expense of trying to get the one goal you’d wished for years.", "How  indifference turned to hate at the sight of your roommate excelling without effort it seemed with their nice equipment while you seemed gone from the beginning with your every day failings. And now, your favorite bench at your favorite place cannot be enjoyed.", "Your roommate got silent. Then spoke once more.", "Your roommate talked. 'I understand your frustration and I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about the contest. But that’s not the whole story. You see, something came up that’s not about the contest.' You pause in your misunderstanding.", "Your roommate continued. 'My mother had gotten sick recently. That was why you heard me crying on the phone. She came down with something that prevents her from living a normal life and someone needs to constantly take care of her.", "My father was going to do that — that is, until my father and my siblings got into a car accident.'", "'That’s why I left the note saying I was leaving for a few days. I didn’t want to tell you everything, because it was a shocking moment for me. You see — they all died in the car accident.' Your roommate started crying, but continued.", "'It’s just me and my mother now. I need to leave town to take care of my mother. I’m the only relative to take care of her. And she’s the only family I have left. So I need to move to Marco City. And I need to quit the job at San Avery.'", "'I need to leave my career of photography and other things so I can be with the only family I have left.'", "You had burst into tears. You didn’t know. How sorry you were for everything you said! You try to say what you can to make things better, but the weight of your roommate seemed so heavy.", "You both talked out things the rest of the night. But that wasn’t all. Your roommate, by giving up photography, gave you their new fancy camera as a farewell gift.", "It was a hard night for both of you. Your roommate ended up leaving to talk to more people before they left. You were left alone, late night at the harbor, to your misapplied emotions and thoughts, and with two cameras, one of which is brand new and yours to keep.", "You arrived at the apartment late, and your roommate wasn’t anywhere to be found again. But you knew what happened and it all made sense. You felt you’ve never been so wrong in your life. Sad and in tears, you went to bed.", "The next morning you received a voicemail, which discussed the contest from the SA Times. It turned out that since your roommate left the job open, the company felt necessary to have a new winner.", "They chose you.", "It turned out that your roommate considered you as they gave up the position, combined with the managers’ adoration of your picture of the Mayor’s first pitch. In a strange mix of delight and sadness, you go for a walk.", "In the midst of your walk, you realized that you had no need for the rental camera anymore.", "Thoughts cycled through your mind. You did everything wrong. You held things against your roommate without realizing what really happened. You hated your roommate and everything else. And now you have the full time job. But... You had everything you wanted.", "This was your window of opportunity. So why are you not filled with happiness?", "You made your way to A Lens Story, where you rented the camera, to turn it back in. The same man was there, the owner, as he turned to you.", "'Welcome to A Lens Story, where every lens has a story. How can I help you?' You fight back the tears and say you wanted to return a rental camera. You recall the last two weeks. The owner was right that every lens has a story. You just wished your story didn’t end the way it did.", "Maybe...maybe it’s not over.", "Photo Request: a window"]
